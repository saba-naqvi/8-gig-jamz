10 Years of Jamz: From 8 gigs of iPod Nano space to 10 days of music

I've been a Spotify user for the past 11 years. I've been curating a playlist (Jamz) with all the music I already loved pre-2012 (before Jamz came into existence) or fell in love with post-2012. This notebook is a small piece of a project I am working on, a deep exploration of Jamz. She's at 3,435 songs strong. It would take almost 10 days to listen to all of her. Last December we celebrated a decade together. 

Something that really interested me was being able to visualize the geographic, cultural, and linguistic origins of the artists I love. With the help of the Spotify and MusicBrainz APIs, this notebook constructs an interactive map of my top 99 'long-term' favorite artists. I don't know if the data truly spans my 11 years as a Spotify user, but it still paints a vivid picture of who I am. With some more time and computing power, I will create this map with all 1500 or so artists that are part of Jamz.
